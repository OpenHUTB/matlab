%CLOSE Close connection to data dictionary
%
%   CLOSE(dictionaryObj) closes the connection between the
%   Simulink.data.Dictionary object dictionaryObj and the data dictionary
%   it represents. As a result, dictionaryObj no longer connects to or
%   represents any data dictionary.
%   
%   Any unsaved changes to the dictionary or its entries are retained after
%   using CLOSE and are still present next time the dictionary is opened.
